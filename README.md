# FASTSpectra
A R package to process hyper-spectral data collected from an Ocean Optics USB2000 spectroradiometer. 
Functions are available to parse 'text + header' files generated by Ocean Optics SpectraSuite, apply radiometric corrections to instrument 'digital number' values using an 'instrument specific response function', correct measurements of a 'reference panel' using the panel-specific reflectance response function and calculate reflectance using specified pairs of sample/reference measurements.

The package is in an early state of development and is mainly intended as a 'helper' for UCA's data processing tasks with the project FAST (http://www.fast-space-project.eu/).
